# Twitter-Archive-Wrangling-Exploring
This project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

This project is a real case of how to gather, assess, clean, and analyze the data in the real world. The database used as an example is about the WeRateDogs Twitter user archive, this account has more than 7,572,000 followers, 9,500 tweets, and 141,000 likes.
The Data Gathering process tackle three different tasks, the first one download file from URL and later loading to the Jupyter Notebook, which requires a manual step, the second downloading a file programmatically, and the third gathering data from the Twitter API. This step has also required to save these data in a local machine.
Based on the data gathered, I have assessed the most evident issues and documented it to create a record of modifications. 
Later, in Data Cleaning process I have fixed all identified issues, and I have also merged (the two downloaded files from the Data Gathering process) into one and added some missing values (from the archive downloaded from the Twitter API). The final data frame was stored as twitter_archive_master.csv.
In the Data Analysis and Visualization, which I have interpreted as Exploratory Analysis, I have tried to find some insights and patterns in my data.
